	UNARJ LICENSE POLICY FOR ALL USERS:

	The UNARJ program, source code, and the associated documentation
	are copyright (c) 1990-2000 ARJ Software, Inc. all rights reserved.

	If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
	distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

	README.DOC
	UNARJ.EXE
	UNARJ.DOC
	UNARJ.C
	DECODE.C
	ENVIRON.C
	UNARJ.H
	UNARJ.DEF
	TCCUNARJ.MAK
	BCCUNARJ.MAK
	BCC32.MAK
	QCLUNARJ.MAK
	OS2UNARJ.MAK
	TECHNOTE.DOC

	We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
	originally released:  UNARJ243.EXE with the ARJ-SECURITY envelope as
	created by the author.  If you must distribute the UNARJ archive in
	another archive format, please archive the UNARJ243.EXE as one file
	inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as separate
	files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

	You may freely use the UNARJ C source code.  If you wish to 
	distribute a modified version of UNARJ.EXE, you MUST indicate that it 
	is a modified version both in the program and source code.

	We are holding the copyright on the source code, so please do not
	delete our name from the program files or the documentation.

	The UNARJ.EXE program is built from this source using Borland C++ 3.1.

	You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
	fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

	You may use UNARJ.EXE in a commercial software package provided that
	no additional fee is charged for using UNARJ.EXE and provided that
	the user fully understands that NO warranty or support is provided
	for UNARJ.EXE by ARJ Software.  Moreover, the user must fully
	understand that UNARJ does not have the long usage history that ARJ
	does.

	This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
	support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.

	       of conditions.

	    2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)

	    3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
	       systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with

	       versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not

	       prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
	       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
	       will provide support for the altered versions.

	    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
	       "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its

	1. The Standard Version of Public UnAce Package may be freely distributed.

	2. The UnAce sources may be used in any software to handle ACE
	archives without limitations free of charge, but must not be used
	to reproduce the ACE compression algorithm.
	This means that that the code must not be used to develop an
	ACE compatible archiver (that is: software capable of compressing to 
	Ace archives) in any way.

	3. Distribution of modified Public UnAce sources (as part of other software 
	or as stand-alone package) requires that it is clearly stated in the 
	documentation and source code that it is distributed under the 
	Public UnAce Licence. 
	The Public UnAce Licence has to be included in this package.

	4. The name of the Copyright Holder or the support of ACE archives may not be

* liblz4-1.9.3 https://github.com/lz4/lz4

	This repository uses 2 different licenses :
	- all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
	- all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

	Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
	and with presence of COPYING or LICENSE file in associated directories.

	This model is selected to emphasize that
	files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party applications,
	while all other files, in `programs`, `tests` or `examples`,
	receive more limited attention and support for such scenario.

* lizard 1.0 https://github.com/inikep/lizard

	This repository uses 2 different licenses :
	- all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
	- all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

	Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
	and with the presence of COPYING or LICENSE file.

	This model emphasizes the fact that
	only files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party projects.

	Other files, such as those from `programs` or `examples` directory,
	are not intended to be compiled outside of their context.
	They can serve as source of inspiration,
	but they should not be copy/pasted into 3rd party projects,
	as this scenario is not supported.


* packMP3 v1.0g https://github.com/packjpg/packMP3

	packMP3 is a compression program specially designed for further 
	compression of MPEG-1 Audio Layer III audio files without causing any 
	further loss. Typically it reduces the file size of a MP3 file by 16% 
	based on tests with 6000 randomly selected files.

	to add PMP support to their software projects.
